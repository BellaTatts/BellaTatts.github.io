Welcome to my work Rabbit!
This Story The premises of the idea is a look at AI in a setting where humankind has eradicated all-natural life 
and now lives in the world of VR. 
Through partial choose your own story are decisions the reader can make to get a certain ending. 
The reason I say a partial choose your own story is because the work is split to be read as two separate readings 
with one story having a more preferable ending then the other. 
One thing that links both of them is the rabbit, which is both a literal entity in the story and the title of my work. 
The rabbit is meant to symbolize both the AI world its memory is trapped in and the physical world where its body is buried.
